**2.Differentiate between Monolith vs Micro-service Architecture.**
Monolithic Architecture:

Definition: Monolithic architecture is a software design approach where all components and functionalities of an application are tightly integrated and packaged together as a single unit. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is deployed as a single, self-contained unit.

Characteristics:

Single Codebase: The entire application is developed and managed within a single codebase.
Tightly Coupled Components: Components within the application are tightly coupled, making it difficult to modify or scale individual functionalities independently.
Scalability Challenges: Scaling a monolithic application usually involves scaling the entire application rather than specific components, which can lead to inefficiencies.
Development and Deployment: Development and deployment processes are typically centralized and involve the entire application.
Example Use-Case: A traditional e-commerce application where the front-end, back-end, and database components are tightly coupled and deployed together as a single unit.

Microservices Architecture:

Definition: Microservices architecture is a software design approach where an application is composed of small, independent services, each responsible for specific business functions. These services are loosely coupled and communicate with each other via APIs.

Characteristics:

Decomposed Services: The application is decomposed into smaller, independent services, each focused on a specific business capability or domain.
Loose Coupling: Services are loosely coupled, allowing them to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other.
Scalability and Flexibility: Microservices architecture allows for easier scalability, as individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
Technology Diversity: Each service can be developed and deployed using different technologies, languages, and frameworks, based on the specific requirements.
Example Use-Case: A social media platform where separate services handle user authentication, content management, messaging, notifications, and analytics, allowing for independent development and scalability of each feature.
